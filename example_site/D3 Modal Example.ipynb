    "# D3js Modal Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok so I spent the past day trying to get a modal to work for a project I have at work that uses Bootstrap 4. Apparently they either depricated the external url modal support or I am too ignorant in JavaScript/HTML/CSS to get it to work (most likely... have I said how much I suck at HTML/JS/CSS!). Because I am the type of person who can't just except that something isn't going to work... I spent the past hour or so exercising my Google Foo and finally found a compatible modal example that uses D3. I don't know a lot of D3 but what I do know I really like it. It is easy to use and for the most part makes sense. So full disclosure I didn't really make this example its just adopted from [HERE](https://bl.ocks.org/lsbardel/964b454dd40bc32082a0753e9106a707). \n",

    "This solution is alright and will work fairly well if you only need a single modal per page. I originally thought I could pass different urls to the `modal_url` variable with D3 and it would dynamically change the page displayed on the modal. I was wrong... or more likely did something wrong again. My belief is that the function that houses the modal loads once and won't load again. I tried changing the function to be callable but there was some issue with `d3.view` I think that would throw an error on the second time the page loaded. There likely is an easy solution to this but my lack of expierence with JavaScript is precluding me at this time from using this method the way I intended to. Luckily I did finally find the prefered Bootstrap method for modals using urls. \n",
